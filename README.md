#Blackjack
This is a project that illustrates the risks of gambling - even in a game with reasonable odds.
This software observes the user playing blackjack and learns the player's strategy.
The user then has an option to manipulate their strategy via a case table, including bet amounts.
The software then simulates a large (10k) number of hands of blackjack, summing total losses and displaying the house edge.
Various blackjack rules can be altered in the code.
